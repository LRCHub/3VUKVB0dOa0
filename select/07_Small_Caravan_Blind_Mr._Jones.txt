All I want is a place of my own,
A small caravan by the sea.
A friend to cook,
A few good books,
And a smoke might just satisfy me.

See that girl with her hips in a song
And a few sound thoughts in her head,
We might find we're two of a kind
And I'll never have to pretend.

That I'm feeling fine.

See that boy with his head in his hands,
Well his head is sharp and clear.
A place to score or a walk by the shore,
And all the sounds you can hear
